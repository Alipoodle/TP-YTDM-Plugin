TouchPortal YTDM Plugin

============--Installation--=============
Only for windows for now Remember that
so download Windows - YTMD Plugin.tpp
install the plugin in TouchPortal then
press Win+R enter %appdata%\TouchPortal\plugins\TouchPortalYTMusic
and press ok
then you should see Login.json
open that with any Text editor
ok just leave that open
so let's get back to YTMD So in the YTMD App
you should see Settings button next to your google account icon
so click that Settings then go to Integrations tab
Enable Remote control also make sure
Protect remote control with password is also on
You should see blue text that are like XXXXX
type that out in the Login.json
replace all the XXXXX with that so mine is N058Z
so if you do everything right it would look like
this {"Password": "N058Z"} but your password is not the
same as mine then after you've done all that save it
and Reopen TouchPortal it should ask you if you want to allow
YTDM plugin click Trust Always! And now your done with Everything
Enjoy!
